# String_printer

#### A simple tool that will help with simplifying the output of code.

**Allows you to organize output into a left/right/center justiifed output, separated with borders (soon to be with your choice of border character), and prints out in a clean and neat format.**

#### Use case below. You can also run the String_printer to see the same thing!

```
/**
 *  you can also replace any of the "print_" commands with "println_" to allow for easy looping 
 *
 *  the parameters in order are
 *	boolean 	- do you want borders?
 *	int		- how big is each column? (not including borders)
 *	String...	- Strings to be used (Arrays are acceptable too)
 */

//Arrays work too!

String arr[] = {"ace", "ventura", "show"};

sp.print_r(false, 20, arr);                        =                  ace             ventura                show
