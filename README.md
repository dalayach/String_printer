# String_printer

A simple tool that will help with simplifying the output of code.

Allows you to organize output into a left/right/center justiifed output, separated with borders (soon to be with your choice of border character), and prints out in a clean and neat format.

Built to assist output of WOT_PlayerComp_V1

*Honestly, I'm building this software for simplicity and to learn how to deploy on maven... :P*
